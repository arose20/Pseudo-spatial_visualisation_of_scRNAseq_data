This repository contains information about visulaising counts based information data through free form polygons. 

This repository is split into the following:
1. Mask generation
    - Options to generate masks in a common co-ordinate framework using either Fiji or Plotly
2. Combine single cell data and masks
    - Adapter notebook to combine the masks and single cell data together (will also work for sci-adifa-elmer web atlas platform)
3. Local visualisation
