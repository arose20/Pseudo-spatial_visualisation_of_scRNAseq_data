Elmer: Exploring Locality Metadata by Encapsulating Representation


This repository contains information about visulaising counts based information data through free form polygons. 

Please look at the following:
- Excel example
- Fiji guide for mask generation
- Plotly notebook using functions defined in python scipt for mask generation through an inline notebook 
- Adapter script for python visualisation 
- Python visualisation notebook using matploltib
- Python visualisation notebook using plotly

Output from the adapter scipt can also be pushed into the sci-elmer-adifa repo to generate your own adifa style web portal for scRNA-seq data
